# Conway-s_Game_of_life
Conway's Game of life using python and tkinter GUI library

TO DO:
- Redesigning the App class to seperate the gui from the logic (sort of MVC)
- Finding a way to speed up the calculations (using GPU with cuda? Multithreading?)
- Dealing with existing grids (ask user if he wants to use an existing grid)
- Create a real Python package (ok, I'm not sure I know what that means :) )
- Check file import/export errors
- Spending time on enjoying the result (Yes, that's important)

That should be good for this project
